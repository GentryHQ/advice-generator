## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS/SASS
- Advice slip API



### What I learned

- My first time working with APIs, async functions and JSON. I learnt how to use the fetch function, work with API: paths, parameters, endpoints and a lot.

- It was really fun,I enjoyed the process of building this web app.

- I had some unexpected hiccup in the CSS positioning. Although my grip on these is really strong, I still encountered some challenges which made me went back learning and it was really great.



### Continued development

- I'm planning on making this full-stack by building my own server to send request and all.
- Would also like to add more features like search, get advice by Id.

### Useful resources

- [Coding train playlist on Data and API](https://youtu.be/DbcLg8nRWEg) - This helped me understand how to work with APIs, Datas like CSV,JSON and lot more.
- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) - This is the amazing website for the Advice slip API docs.
